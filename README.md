## HOTS LOGS and Masterleague Scrapers

This is code for scraping Heroes of the Storm data from HOTS LOGS and Masterleague. If you are using this code, please, scrape responsibly and include `Sys.sleep()` commands in your code. The website author will appreciate it very much.

The data provided from HOTS LOGS helps me create the graphs you will find on [ggplots.com](http://www.ggplots.com)
